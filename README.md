🎮 GamersHub
GamersHub is my first e-commerce front-end project focused on building a clean, functional shopping experience for gamers. I built this to practice core web development concepts like responsive layout, component structure, user interaction and semantic HTML.

💡 What I Learned
HTML5 & CSS: Structuring a multi-page site and using Flexbox/Grid for the layout.

Responsive Design: Making sure the store looks good on both phones and laptops.

Version Control: Using Git and GitHub to manage my code and deployments.

🕹️ Current Features

Product cards displaying prices and "Add to Cart" buttons.

A dedicated "About" section explaining the shop's mission.
